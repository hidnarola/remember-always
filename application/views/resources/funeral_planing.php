                                        <p> If the decision is a traditional burial, then you will need to choose a Funeral Home / Funeral Director.You will also need to pick a casket, choose a cemetery, and secure a burial spot.  You will need a burial permit. If you use a funeral home, they will include this as a part of their service.You will also need to decide on a memorial/grave marker and the inscription to be on it, but this does not have to be done immediately.</p>
                                        <p>If entombment, you will need to choose a mausoleum, and a tomb.</p>
                                        <p>If cremation, you will need to choose a crematory. <br/>You (the family) will also need to determine how the ashes will be handled – handed over to a single person in a single container, split (multiple containers to multiple family members) or scattered.You will also need to choose an urn (container for the ashes) or urns (if ashes will be split for multiple family members).</p>
                                        <p>If your loved one had chosen to donate their body to science or organs to someone in need, then of course, there would be no burial, entombment, or creation.   You would need to inform the hospital that your loved one is a body or organ donator.  </p>
                                        <p>You may contact the below organizations to learn more about donating a loved one’s body to science.</p>

                                        <p>When a loved one passes away, there are some significant expenses that arise from carrying out the various end-of-life events.  These expenses can be overwhelming, and especially so if the passing was unexpected. </p>
                                        <p><strong>Keep costs low</strong> <br/>
                                            The average traditional funeral cost approx. $7,500.  But with the very basics, a funeral can cost approx. $3,000.</p>
                                        <p>You can also consider a cremation, where a basic cremation cost approx. $1,000. Make sure to get a full and complete estimate with itemized costs from the funeral homes or crematories you are considering.  Stay focused on what you need and avoid unnecessary services that the funeral home may try to upsell you on.</p>

                                                    When applicable and possible, split the costs among a few close family members.  For example, for the funeral of an elderly parent, the adult children can choose to split the funeral expenses in some way, easing the burden on any one person.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Check with the employer of the deceased person</strong> In some cases, the employer of a person who has died may have benefits that cover some funeral expenses.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Check the Social Security Benefits for the survivor of the deceased person</strong>
                                                    If the person that has died was receiving Social Security Benefits, the surviving spouse may be entitled to a one-time benefit of about $250 to help with funeral expenses.  Although this is not a large amount, it can still be very helpful if you are on a tight budget.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Benefits for Veterans</strong> <br/> There are some benefits available for veterans for funeral expenses.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Create an online memorial fundraiser</strong> Create an online memorial fundraiser, such as the Tribute Fundraiser on the Remember Always site, to secure donations from family and friends.  These people will be honored to help in any way they can.  And many small donations add up to a significant amount of money, while being a non-burden to each donor.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Get a funeral expenses loan</strong> There are several companies that offer loans for covering funeral expenses.  You could also get a personal loan. However, in this age of social media and crowd-funding, why would you not do a memorial fundraiser instead?</li>
